<h3>My Recipe Book for You</h3>
<p>During Lockdown lots of us have had alot of time on our hands and I have decided that I would like to build a website where people can visit and view recipes and try them out for themselves.
I have also decided that if you want to create a recipe you can do so by sending me your recipe with a list of ingredients and how you
put together your recipe together. I will publish the recipe
and accredit your name at the bottom of the recipe. So if you see an empty page and you have a recipe to fill that space, please get in touch.
